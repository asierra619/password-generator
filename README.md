# Custom Password Generator

## Description

This Password Generator was a challenge for me to practice my skills with JavaScript. As a student of Full Stack Web Development, I need to continue to practice to become a competitive developer to earn my way into the career I'm seeking. I built this to work on my knowledge of arrays, functions, and event listeners. 

The problem that this generator solves is for anyone in need of a new password. With a few clicks, a user is able to customize a password anywhere between 8 and 128 characters, including lowercase, uppercase, and/or special characters, as well as numbers if they are desired. This project has taught me to focus on my declarations and the defining of variables in my code, and of course, my eyes are slightly more open to the miniscule details that troubled me during the process.

## Usage

Using the link below, a user will click on the "Generate Password" button, enter how many characters they would like to have, and finally continue through the prompts on whether or not they'd like other types of characters in the password (at least one must be selected).

When all prompts have been responded to, a random password will be generated on screen.
